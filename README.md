# CrossLayout

#### Maybe you are typing with your keyboard But forget to check that the input language of the system is not the language you are typing;

#### At this moment, the smoke rises from your head and you become angry But don't worry, this program can solve your problem Just put the file like I made next to the program and run the program


The generality of that file is that for all keyboard letters, including English and Farsi, it has a value for that letter in its opposite language.

### *Look at your keyboard for example:*
------------------------------------
What are the letters of __п┤__ your keyboard? => a

What are the letters of __f__ your keyboard? => пе
 
##### And the same in the rest of the letters The program recognizes which one of these letters has a value on the keyboard in another language
